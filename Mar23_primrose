Primrose awoke with a sleepy yawn, her petals still tightly furled. Unlike her silent sisters, Primrose knew this wouldn't last. Every spring, she sprouted a voice as vibrant as the sunshine itself.

"Good morning, sleepyheads!" she declared, her voice a chiming melody that fluttered on the breeze.

A bee buzzed by, startled. "Did that sunflower just… talk?"

Primrose giggled. "Sunflower? I'm Primrose, silly! And yes, I can talk, but only during the magic time of spring."

News of the talking flower spread like wildfire… well, more like a gentle breeze, really. Soon, the entire meadow buzzed with curious insects. A ladybug perched on Primrose's velvety head. "What's it like to speak?" she asked, her voice a tiny squeak.

Primrose described the world – the sweet scent of honeysuckle, the warmth of the sun on her petals, the silly songs of the birds. The ladybug listened, wide-eyed. For the first time, she felt like she truly understood the world around her.

A wise old grasshopper hopped by. "You have a gift, Primrose," he rasped. "Share the stories you hear from the wind."

So Primrose did. She told of faraway lands where exotic flowers bloomed, of whispering rain showers painting the meadow green, and of brave butterflies migrating on wings of wind.

The meadow came alive with tales. The ants built castles inspired by the wind's stories of towering mountains. The crickets chirped their own songs, a melody woven from the tales of distant lands.

As summer arrived, Primrose's voice began to fade. "I'm happy I could share," she whispered, her petals drooping a little.

"Thank you, Primrose," a chorus of voices buzzed and chirped. "You made our meadow a place of wonders."

Primrose smiled, a silent promise blooming within her. Next spring, under the warm sunshine, she would have a whole new set of stories to tell. The meadow, and all its curious creatures, would be waiting.
