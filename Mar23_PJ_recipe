Ingredients:

8 large eggs
1/4 cup milk (whole milk or your favorite dairy alternative)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced
1 cup asparagus, trimmed and chopped
1 cup fresh peas (or frozen peas, thawed)
1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese (optional)
1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, chives, or dill)
Instructions:

Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 10-inch oven-safe skillet with olive oil.
Whisk together eggs, milk, Parmesan cheese, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
Heat olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
Add the asparagus and peas to the skillet and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender-crisp.
Pour the egg mixture into the skillet with the vegetables. Stir gently to distribute the vegetables evenly.
Sprinkle the top of the frittata with goat cheese (if using) and fresh herbs.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the center of the frittata is set and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Let the frittata cool slightly before slicing and serving.
